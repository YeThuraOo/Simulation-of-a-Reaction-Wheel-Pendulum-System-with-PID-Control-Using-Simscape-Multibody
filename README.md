The simulation and control of a reaction wheel pendulum system using Simscape Multibody in MATLAB/Simulink

  This simulation demonstrates the application of control engineering principles, particularly the design and implementation of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, to stabilize the pendulum in an upright position
  The reaction wheel pendulum, a classic example of an underactuated system, is modeled and simulated within the Simscape Multibody environment to accurately capture the dynamics and interactions of its mechanical components. The PID controller is designed to regulate the reaction wheel's angular velocity, thereby providing the necessary control torque to maintain the pendulum's balance. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the control strategy, making the study a useful demonstration for control engineering students and professionals exploring the practical application of PID control in dynamic multibody systems.
